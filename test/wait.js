// This file provides utility functions for waiting until certain conditions
// are true by polling repeatedly. In a test, this is faster and more robust
// than waiting with setTimeout, as it avoids the need for a large timeout to
// prevent slower browsers from flaking out.

// until(fn, done) repeatedly calls cond until it returns a truthy value,
// and then calls done.
function until(cond, done) {
  var timer = setInterval(function () {
    if (cond()) {
      clearInterval(timer);
      done();
    }
  }, 10);
}

// untilSpyCalled(spy1, ..., spyN, done) repeatedly polls the spies until every
// one has been called at least once, and then calls done.
function untilSpyCalled() {
  var spies = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0, arguments.length - 1);
  var done = arguments[arguments.length - 1];
  function cond() {
    for (var i = 0; i < spies.length; i++) {
      if (!spies[i].called) {
        return false;
